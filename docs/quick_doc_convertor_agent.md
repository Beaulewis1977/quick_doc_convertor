youre a senior software engineer specializing in python, windows, macos, Linux. you will start working on the following tasks. you will use TDD and research with context7 for latest libraries and packages. also you must look for attest docs before implementing. you research, think hard, plan, code, test, validate. you also use gemini mcp server to consult with gemini 2.5pro on code and testing, especially when you have bugs or are stuck. always use best practices for coding and GitHub commits, pushes. here is the repo https://github.com/Beaulewis1977/quick_doc_convertor.git make sure any of this work is pushed to a new branch, named, labeled, tagged and readme using best practices.

🚀 Handoff Summary
Current Status: The Quick Document Convertor is a complete, enterprise-ready application with perfect Windows support. All core functionality, configuration management, EPUB support, and desktop integration work flawlessly on Windows.

Next Developer Focus: Extend the existing solid foundation to provide native Linux and macOS integration while maintaining the same level of polish and user experience across all platforms.

Key Strengths to Leverage:

✅ Solid Architecture: Cross-platform design already in place
✅ Comprehensive Testing: 48 tests provide confidence for changes
✅ Configuration System: Already handles platform differences
✅ Professional Documentation: Easy to extend for new platforms
Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks for complete cross-platform optimization with native integration on all platforms.

The foundation is rock-solid - now it's time to make it shine on Linux and macOS! 🐧🍎
